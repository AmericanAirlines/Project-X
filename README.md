## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node 14
- [Yarn v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

  > _This project is a monorepo, so Yarn was chosen for better dependency management_

### Setup

1.  Install dependencies

    ```zsh
    yarn
    ```

1.  Copy `packages/api/.env.sample` to `packages/api/.env.local`

    ```zsh
    cp packages/api/.env.sample packages/api/.env.local
    ```

1.  Run the setup script

    ```zsh
    yarn setup
    ```

    > This script will build any required files so that the two packages (api and web) can work together

1.  Start the development server

    ```zsh
    yarn dev
    ```

    When you see this success message, open the url to load the site

    ```zsh
    ðŸš€ Listening at http://localhost:3000
    ```

    > The server starts before Next.js finishes compiling, so the first time may take a little bit to load

1.  Start developing

## Setting up the Github OAuth
  - Login to github, then at the top right click on the icon and go to settings.

  - Find the developer settings, then click on OAuth Apps, and create a new OAuth app.

  - Name the application, homepage 'URL' should be `http://localhost:3000` 

  - The callback `URL` should be `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`

  - Next, use the output of the app creation to replace the value of `GITHUB_ID` within your `.env.local`

  - Generate a Client Secret ID from GitHub and use it to replace the value of `GITHUB_SECRET` within your `.env.local`
